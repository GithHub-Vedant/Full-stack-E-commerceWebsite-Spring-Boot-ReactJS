## Project Overview

This e-commerce application provides a complete online shopping experience with modern UI/UX design. It includes product browsing, cart management, user authentication, and order processing functionality. The application is built with a React frontend and Spring Boot backend, providing a seamless shopping experience.

## Business Problem

Traditional e-commerce platforms often lack responsive design, have complex user interfaces, and suffer from slow loading times. This project addresses these issues by implementing a modern, fast, and user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across all devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 19
- Vite (build tool and development server)
- React Router DOM v7 (routing)
- CSS for styling
- JWT-based authentication system

### Backend
- Spring Boot
- Java
- JWT for authentication
- JPA/Hibernate for database operations
- MySQL database

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Java 21+ (for backend)
- MySQL 8.0+ (or compatible database)

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd ecommerce-frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd ecommerce-backend`
2. Update database configuration in `application.properties`
3. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the frontend root directory with the following structure:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

**Important Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files including `.env`, configuration files, and database credentials.

## Customization

### Frontend Customization
- Update theme colors in CSS files
- Modify component styling in individual component files
- Add new product categories by updating the category filter
- Customize product display by modifying the Item component

### Backend Customization
- Add new product attributes by extending the Product entity
- Modify authentication requirements in SecurityConfig
- Add new API endpoints in controller classes
- Customize business logic in service implementations

### Database Customization
- Modify schema by updating JPA entity classes
- Add database indexes for improved performance
- Configure database connection pooling

### API Endpoints

#### Product API
- `GET /api/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `GET /api/products/category/{category}` - Get products by category
- `GET /api/products/new` - Get new products

#### Cart API
